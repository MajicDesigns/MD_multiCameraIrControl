# Multi Camera IR Control

[![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/MD_multiCameraIrControl.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/MD_multiCameraIrControl)

A library to control various cameras using IR. The Arduino sends IR signals compatible with IR remotes for cameras from Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, Minolta and Sony.

## Important Note:
This is not an original work by me and I make no claim that it is. It is a modernization of a library originally call <i>multiCameraIrControl</i> by Sebastian Setz. Despite extensive research I have been unable to contact the original author to collaborate on this upgrade.

The original library was last updated in 2013 and the links in the code are long dead. The latest web archive of the original developer's page is https://web.archive.org/web/20170109013317/http://sebastian.setz.name/arduino/my-libraries/multi-camera-ir-control/?replytocom=10099

The <i>multiCameraIrControl</i> library can be found in various versions around the web but have not been updated in recent times. To avoid confusion with the original, I have renamed this derivation to <i>MD_multiCameraIrControl</i> in line with the other libraries I maintain.
